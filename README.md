# Testing-ESP8266-Websocket-Controls  
- An arduino project I am playing around with on my NodeMCU-V3.
- Currently this has multiple onboard LED control functions.
- I plan to intergrate what I have learnt here to control a DC motor with it.
- I've left my HTML and JS scripts in here you you can read the wep pages easier and see how I minify the files. 
- This is also my first time using C++ :)
